          <p class="wyzeText">This is probably my favorite smart products company. From cameras to earbuds, they have so many affordable, yet very high quality products that just make life better. I especially love their Cam v3 and Robot Vacuum. I like to stay up to date on their new products and features and I like messing with my cameras and vacuum often.</p>

          <p class="pianoText">Although I haven't taken classes of any sort, I learn my songs using YouTube videos and just completely memorize them. I can play a few songs, including Fur Elise, Canon in D, and Leidenschaft. </p>

          <h2 class="workouth2">Working out</h2>
          <p class="workoutText">Some may see working out as a chore, but I thoroughly enjoy it! Not only is it so very good for you in every way, but it is just a good way to take your mind off of things. I only do bodyweight because it's safer and better as you work out your muscles together (as they were made to) instead of focusing on just one or a few parts and neglecting others. A workout book I like to use is Convict Conditioning and it really works -- I can do handstand pushups because of it!</p>
